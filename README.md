# Food-Delivery-App

This project was developed during the MC322 undergraduate subject, which focused on studying Object Oriented Programming.

The aim of this project is to build a Food Delivery Application using Java. It allows new users to register on the app and order food. The app features a wide range of restaurants, each one having its own menu. Furthermore, the users are able to keep track of the status of their order and are also able to rate the restaurant, order itself and the person responsible for delivering the food as well.
